1) What is Truffle?
2) What is Ganache?
3) Demonstrate the installation process of Truffle suite and display
the current version of Truffle installed in your computer.
4) Demonstrate the process of unboxing the metacoin project and briefly explore the project structure by explaining the items.

Answers:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) *Truffle is a world class development environment,asset pipeline and testing framework of the Truffle Suite ecosystem.
   
   *Truffle is a hugely popular development framework among developers for Ethereum dApp development and there is a large community behind the tool.
   
   *Truffle uses EVM as a basis.
   
   *It makes the development of smart contract and dApp more accessible and manageable.


Asset Pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress javascript and css asset.


2) --> Ganache is a tool to set up our own local Ethereum Blockchain that we can use to deploy and test our smart contracts/dApp before launching them on           
authentic blockchain.
   -->Ganache allows us to set up a local ethereum blockchain to test our dApps in a safe environment.
   -->Ganache helps developers to save time and space, and to avoid paying unneccesary gas fees.

3) To demonstrate the installation process of the truffle suite,Follow the steps below-
   
   Step 1--> Prerequisites- Before istalling truffle,make sure you have node.js and npm installed in your system

   Step 2--> Installing Truffle- To install Truffle,open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command
   
   npm install -g truffle
 
   Step 3--> Verify Truffle installation by running the following  command- 

              truffle version

   the output will generate the current version of truffle on your system.

C:\Users\Shivam>truffle version
Truffle v5.10.2 (core: 5.10.2)
Ganache v7.8.0
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v18.16.0
Web3.js v1.10.0

4) To demonstrate the process of unboxing the metacoin project,Follow the steps below-

   Step 1--> Crete a new directory for your Truffle project using Command Prompt.
             mkdir MetaCoin
             cd MetaCoin
 
   Step 2--> Download (unbox) the MetaCoin box.
         
             truffle unbox metacoin 

  
Once this operation is completed,then we will now have a project structure with the following items-

 **contracts/ : Directory for solidity contract.

 **migration/ : Directory for scriptable deployment files.

 **test/ : Directory for test files for testing your dApp and contracts.

 **truffle-config.js : Truffle configuration file,for setting n/w information and other project-related settings.
